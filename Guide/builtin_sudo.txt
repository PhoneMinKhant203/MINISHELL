===== builtin.c =====

init_env
Goal : Take the standard envrionment array (string like "USER=student") and turn them into a linked list so we can easily add or remove variables.

1. Create an empty list called head
2. Loop through each string in the system's envp array:
	2.1 Find where the = character is located
	2.2 Key: Copy everything before that =
	2.3 Value: Copy everything after the =
	2.4 Create a new node with that Key and Value
	2.5 Attach this node to the front of our list
3. Return the full list


find_env_node
Goal : Look through our list to find a specific variable (searching for like "HOME")

1. Start at the beginning of the envrionment list
2. While we haven't reached the end
	2.1 Compare the current node's Key with the Key we are looking for
	2.2 If they are a perfect match, (same length and characters)
		return that node 
	2.3 Otherwise, move to the next node
3. If the loop finishes and we found nothing, 
	return NULL


is_builtin 
Goal : Check if the command inputed by the user is one of the 7 specific commands that our shell handles internally

1. If there is no command, return false zero
2. Compre the command name with echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env or exit
3. If it matches any of these exactly, return true one
4. Otherwise, return false zero


exec_builtin 
Goal : When we know if a command is a built in, this function is to actually run the correct helper function

1. Look at the first argument (name of command)
2. If it is "echo", run mini_echo function
3. Else if it is "pwd", run our mini_pwd function
4. Else if it is "cd", run our mini_cd function
5. Else if it is "env", run our mini_env function
6. Else if it is "export", run our mini_export function
7. Else if it is "unset", run our mini_unset function
8. Else if it is "exit", run our mini_exit function
