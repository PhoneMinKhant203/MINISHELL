minishell VS bash
.....................
==== WE START HERE ====
---------------------
7. check exit code                -> exit (arg)

check env -

8. SHELLlvl and SHELL - need to confirm (has to be bash not zsh)

10. PWD, OLD_PWD (need to reflect based on current dir) cd test

11. _ in env represents current command


built-in commands -

12. echo (-n flag doesn't work as expected as in bash) - 
	e.g "echo -n -n -n hello" , "echo -nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn hello", "echo -n -n-n hello"
echo *, echo ~, echo #, echo ***
$echo or $arg , $echo hello


13. cd ( "cd -" '-' means OLD_PWD, so need to change dir to OLD_PWD)
	("cd ~" "~" means HOME)
	(cd .. ..) (cd /MINISHELL .. ..) bash: cd: too many arguments
	cd - save PWD, OLD_PWD, 
	
14.
minishell$ mkdir test_dir
minishell$ cd test_dir/
minishell$ pwd
/home/wintoo/42/MS_3/minishell/MINISHELL/test_dir
minishell$ rmdir ../test_dir/
minishell$ pwd
pwd: No such file or directory


15. export cmd substitution - Compare with bash
-> export tauk=$(ls -la) , export tak=$(ls) , export a=$($tauk -a)


16. Heredocs
minishell$ << HERE cat
> hello
> HERE

hello

17. Multiple file creation

.....................

1. Basic Successful Expansion
	Input: cat < $USER

	Expectation: If $USER is wintoo, it should open the file wintoo. No error.

	Logic Check: Does expand_str return the correct string?


2. The Ambiguous Redirect (Empty Variable)
	Input: cat > $EMPTY_VAR

	Expectation: minishell: $EMPTY_VAR: ambiguous redirect and sh->last_status = 1.

	Logic Check: Since $EMPTY_VAR is NULL or "", the if (!*path || (*path)[0] == '\0') block should trigger.


3. The Ambiguous Redirect (Unset Variable)
	Input: ls > $VAR_NOT_EXISTING

	Expectation: minishell: $VAR_NOT_EXISTING: ambiguous redirect.

	Logic Check: Ensures your env_get doesn't crash on unset variables and that expand_redir catches the empty result.


4. Quoted Empty Variable (The "Gotcha")
	Input: cat < "$EMPTY_VAR"

	Expectation: Bash behavior varies here, but usually, "$EMPTY_VAR" expands to "" (a literal empty string). If a file named "" (empty name) doesn't exist, it usually fails with No such file or directory, not ambiguous redirect.

	Logic Check: See how your expand_str handles double quotes around an empty variable.


5. Multi-Word Expansion (Advanced)
	Input: export FILE="a b" ; cat < $FILE

	Expectation: minishell: $FILE: ambiguous redirect.

	Context: In real Bash, if a variable expands to two words (due to the space), it's ambiguous. Your current code might not catch this yet (it treats "a b" as one filename), but it's a great test for the future!


6. Expansion with Text
	Input: echo hello > file_$USER

	Expectation: If $USER is wintoo, it creates file_wintoo.

	Logic Check: Ensures the append_str logic correctly joins literal text with expanded text in the filename.


7. Exit Status Expansion
	Input: cat < file_$?

	Expectation: If the last command failed (status 1), it looks for file_1.

	Logic Check: Ensures sh->last_status is correctly pulled into the filename.


8. Double Expansion in Filename
	Input: ls > $USER_$HOME.txt

	Expectation: Expands both variables into a single long filename.


9. Special Characters in Filename
	Input: touch "file with spaces" ; cat < "file with spaces"

	Expectation: Should correctly expand/handle the filename without splitting it.


10. Ambiguous Infile vs. Valid Outfile
	Input: cat < $EMPTY > outfile

	Expectation: Error minishell: $EMPTY: ambiguous redirect. Command should not execute. outfile might be created (Bash creates outfiles even if the command fails), but last_status must be 1
